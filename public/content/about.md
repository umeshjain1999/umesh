Hey there! 👋🏽

I'm Umesh, web aficionado (haha) started my programming journey as I entered into my engineering college. Believe it or not, before that, I didn't know much about computers!😅 But one thing led to another, and I found my jam in crafting user interfaces on the web.

In the initial years of college, I used to live within my own shell than started exploring things such as participating in hackathons and guess what? In one of those exhilarating events, our team snagged the runner-up title! 🎉

I have like made 100s of lovely friends ❤️ when I joined NSS, UBA organization during college time volunteered blood donation campaigns, set up camps in villages to help with local problems, and engaged in countless experiences.

I play football sometimes and sometimes I sketch.

From sketching I developed my interest towards creating interfaces so that's why frontend. I sometimes go through open-source code to learn, keep myself update to date with latest happenings in my domain.

But wait, here's the latest twist in my journey: I'm learning the art of boxing! 🥊

That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case you know something about me that I still don't, please let me know - I'll add it here.
